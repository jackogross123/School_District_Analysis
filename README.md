# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analyis
The academic board for the PyCity School District is under the impression that some students in the district engaged in academic dishonesty. More specifically, Maria's supervisor and the board believe that 9th graders at Thomas High School altered their reading and math scores. The board wants Maria to reconduct the analysis, but replacing the 9th grade scores with Nans. The original analysis can be found here and the completed challenge analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/jackogross123/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb).
