# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analyis
The academic board for the PyCity School District is under the impression that some students in the district engaged in academic dishonesty. More specifically, Maria's supervisor and the board believe that 9th graders at Thomas High School altered their reading and math scores. The board wants Maria to reconduct the analysis, but replacing the 9th grade scores with Nans. The original analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/jackogross123/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools.ipynb) and the completed challenge analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/jackogross123/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb). In the challenge, the board wanted Maria to find:
- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
